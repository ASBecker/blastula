After we create the an `email_message` object with `compose_email()`, we can choose to send it through an SMTP server using **blastula**'s `smtp_send()` function. There is some system setup required before sending a **blastula** email message via SMTP. The main considerations are:

- installation of the cross-platform `mailsend-go` binary
- modifying an account-level setting on Gmail if using that for sending email
- optionally storing SMTP server and auth settings and as a credentials file or as environment variables

We'll go through each of these setup steps before getting into several sending examples with `smtp_send()`.

## Installation of `mailsend-go`

The **blastula** package is moving toward using a new binary for `smtp` mailing, provided by the **mailsend-go** project. This binary is cross-platform and works on **Windows**, **macOS** (via **Homebrew**), and **Linux** (**Debian** and **RPM** packages).

### Windows

Get the latest [64-bit](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases/download/v1.0.3/mailsend-go_1.0.3_windows_64-bit.zip) or [32-bit](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases/download/v1.0.3/mailsend-go_1.0.3_windows_32-bit.zip) release.

Unzip and copy `mailsend-go-dir\mailsend-go.exe` to the Windows PATH. Optionally, we can place the executable in the working directory of the **R** project that is sending email.

### macOS (Homebrew)

Ensure that [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed. Then use the following to install `mailsend-go`:

```
$ brew tap muquit/mailsend-go https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go.git
$ brew install mailsend-go
```

### Ubuntu and Debian

Get the latest release of the [Debian package](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases/download/v1.0.3/mailsend-go_linux_64-bit.deb). Then use the following to install `mailsend-go`:

```
$ sudo dpkg -i mailsend-go_linux_64-bit.deb 
```

### RPM Package

Get the latest release of the [RPM package](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases/download/v1.0.3/mailsend-go_linux_64-bit.rpm). Then use the following to install `mailsend-go`:

```
$ rpm -Uvh mailsend-go_linux_64-bit.rpm
```

## Requirement for Using Gmail

Before using **Gmail** to send out email through **blastula**, there is a key **Gmail** account setting that must changed from the default value. We have to allow *Less Secure Apps* to use your the **Gmail** account. Details on how to make this account-level change can be found in [this support document](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).

## Creating a Credentials File

We can store email credentials in a file using the `create_email_creds_file()` function. Here is an example showing how to create a credentials file as a hidden file (named `.email_creds`) in the working directory.

```{r credentials_1, eval=FALSE}
# Create a credentials file to facilitate
# the sending of email messages
create_email_creds_file(
  user = "personal@email.net",
  password = "<user_password>",
  host = "smtp.youremailserver.org",
  port = 465,
  use_ssl = TRUE,
  sender = "The User's Name",
  creds_file_name = ".email_creds"
)
```

We can also use preset SMTP settings. For example, if we would like to send email through **Gmail**, we can supply `provider = gmail` to not have to worry about the SMTP server details.

```{r credentials_2, eval=FALSE}
# Create a credentials file for sending
# email through Gmail
create_email_creds_file(
  user = "user_name@gmail.com",
  password = "<user_password>",
  provider = "gmail",
  sender = "Sender Name"
)
```

This will create a hidden credentials file in the working directory, the name of which is based on the provider (you can optionally specify the name with the `creds_file_name` argument, as in the first example).

## Sending Email 

Once the `mailsend-go` binary is installed and on the system path, we can use the in-development `smtp_send()` function for sending email. 

Currently, only the development version of the package (on **GitHub**) has the `smtp_send()` function. The other function for sending email, `send_email_out()`, will undergo deprecation.

Let's create a simple test message with the `prepare_test_message()` function.

```{r prepare_test_message, eval=FALSE}
# Create the test message, this returns
# an `email_message` object
test_message <- prepare_test_message()

# Preview the message in the Viewer
test_message
```

<p align="center"><img src="prepare_test_message.png" width="600px"></p>

<p align="center">The test message</p>

Now that this test message is available, we can experiment with the sending of it to a personal email account.

```{r smtp_send_creds, eval=FALSE}
# Sending email to a personal account
# using the credentials file
smtp_send(
  email = email_object,
  from = "personal@email.net",
    to = "personal@email.net",
  subject = "Testing the `smtp_send()` function",
  creds_file = ".email_creds"
)
```

If the SMTP credentials are correctly set, we will get the following message in the console:

```
The email message was sent successfully.
```

We can alternatively use environment variables or even plaintext to send the email message through `smtp_send()`. Here is an example where environment variables contain the key pieces of information for the `sender`, `host`, `port`, `user`, and `password` arguments.

```{r smtp_send_2, eval=FALSE}
# Sending email using environment variables
smtp_send(
  email = email_object,
  from = "personal@email.net",
    to = "personal@email.net",
  subject = "Testing the `smtp_send()` function",
  sender = Sys.getenv("BLS_SENDER"),
  host = Sys.getenv("BLS_HOST"),
  port = Sys.getenv("BLS_PORT"),
  user = Sys.getenv("BLS_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("BLS_PASSWORD")
)
```

Should you have the `mailsend-go` executable in a location that is not in the system path or in the working directory, we can specify its exact location using the `binary_loc` argument.

```{r smtp_binary_loc, eval=FALSE}
# Sending email to a personal account
# using the credentials file
smtp_send(
  email = email_object,
  from = "personal@email.net",
    to = "personal@email.net",
  subject = "Testing the `smtp_send()` function",
  creds_file = ".email_creds",
  binary_loc = "/path/to/mailsend-go" 
)
```

Want to debug the usage of the `mailsend-go` command during sending? We can use the `echo` and `echo_cmd` arguments. Setting `echo` to `TRUE` will print the standard output and error to the console during sending. If `echo_cmd` is set to `TRUE`, we will get the system command printed to the console during the send. Here's an example where both options are enabled:

```{r smtp_send_echo, eval=FALSE}
# Sending email and echoing the system
# command, the stdout, and the stderr
smtp_send(
  email = email_object,
  from = "personal@email.net",
    to = "personal@email.net",
  subject = "Testing the `smtp_send()` function",
  creds_file = "gmail_creds",
  echo = TRUE,
  echo_cmd = TRUE
)
```

```
Running /usr/local/bin/mailsend-go -sub 'Testing the `smtp_send()` function' \
  -smtp smtp.youremailserver.org -port 465 -ssl auth -user 'personal@email.net' -pass \
  <user_password> -fname 'Full Name' -from 'personal@email.net' -to \
  'personal@email.net' attach -file message_inlined.html -mime-type text/html \
  -inline
Mail Sent Successfully
The email message was sent successfully.
```

## Concluding

This covers the basics on how to get up and running on sending emails through **blastula**'s SMTP functionality. Again, this article applies only to the in-development version of **blastula**, which can be installed using:

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("rich-iannone/blastula")
```

Because the `smtp_send()` is quite new, there are bound to be some problems with it. If you encounter a bug or just have a question or feature request, please file an [issue](https://github.com/rich-iannone/blastula/issues).
