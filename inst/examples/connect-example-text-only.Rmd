# An R Markdown Document for Sending an Email

We can create a text-only email using **RStudio Connect**. None of the content from this R Markdown file will be included in the email message body, but, we can elect to attach the output file.

Only one function is required, it's from the **blastula** package and it's called `connect_email()`. Files can be attached using the `attachments` argument

```{r connect_email, echo=FALSE}
connect_email(  
  subject = "RStudio Connect Text Email",
  attachments = "austin_home_sales.csv",
  text = "

Hello,

This is a test email. It contains only text and it's a great option if you only want to send a simple email.

We can still include attachments. Here, a CSV file is attached to this email (`austin_home_sales.csv`).
