# An Email Document Sent Through RStudio Connect (by way of R Markdown)

We can include artifacts from the `connect-example-main.Rmd` document by adding an empty R Markdown code chunk with a matching name (in this case `cars`).

```{r cars}
```


## Including Plots

Plots can be included in an email sent via RStudio Connect. The plot in the `connect-example-main.Rmd` document is in the code chunk called `pressure`. Just as above, an empty code chunk here with the same name will includw that already-generated plot in the email message body:

```{r pressure}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
