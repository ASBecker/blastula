# An R Markdown Document for Sending an Email

We can create a text-only email using **RStudio Connect**. None of the content from this R Markdown file will be included in the email message body, but, we can elect to attach the output file.

Only one function is required, it's from the **blastula** package and it's called `connect_email()`.

```{r connect_email, echo=FALSE}
connect_email(  
  subject = "RStudio Connect Example Email",
  attach_output = TRUE,
  text = "

Hello,

This is a test email. It contains only text and it's a great option if you only want to send a simple email.
"
)
```
