The **blastula** package makes it easy to produce and send HTML email from **R**. The message body can be highly customized with **Markdown** text, the results of **R** expressions, and even raw HTML.

### Installation Requirements

Blastula is moving toward using a new binary for `smtp` mailing, provided by the **mailsend-go** project. This binary is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS (via Homebrew), and Linux (Debian and RPM packages). Installation instructions
can be found at [here](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go#downloading-and-installing).

Once the `mailsend-go` binary is installed and on the system path, we can use the new `smtp_send()` function for sending email. The other function for sending email  (`smtp_send()`) will undergo deprecation.

### Composing an Email Message Object

Here's an example that shows a basic workflow for composing the message, creating optional on-disk credentials for email, and sending out the message.

These functions can help us do just that:

- `compose_email()`: generates the email message content inside the `email_message`-class object
- `create_email_creds_file()`: generates an optional on-disk file with email credentials
- `smtp_send()`: sends the HTML-based email to one or more recipients

A few other functions allow us to easily insert HTML fragments into the message body. These are:

- `add_image()`: for embedding a local image file into the message body
- `add_ggplot()`: converts a ggplot plot object to an image for embedding
- `add_imgur_image()`: simultaneously deploys an image to the **Imgur** service and provides an `<img>` tag pointing to the external image
- `add_readable_time()`: get the current time as a nicely readable string
- `add_cta_button()`: add a call-to-action (CTA) button with button text and a link

When you compose an email, you can use objects from the global workspace and work them into the message content. Here, I'll create a nicely formatted date/time string (`current_date_time`) with the package's `add_readable_time()` function, and, assign a link to an web image to an object (`img_link`).

```{r}
# Get a nicely formatted date/time string
current_date_time <- add_readable_time()

# Assign an URL with an image to `img_link`
img_link <- "https://i.imgur.com/p1KvgYj.png"
```

Now we use the `compose_email()` function to compose the email. There are two main arguments here, `body` and `footer`. You can supply **Markdown** text to each of these. All other valid **Markdown** conventions should render to valid HTML.

The insertion of HTML fragments or text can be performed by enclosing valid R code inside of curly braces (`{...}`). Below the image URL (as part of the `![...](...)` **Markdown** link construction) is referenced to the `img_link` object from the global workspace. Note also that `{current_date_time}` references the `current_date_time` character object generated earlier via the `add_readable_time()` function. The end result is the insertion of the date/time string into the footer of the email. (Alternatively, `add_readable_time()` could have been called directly.)

We can also supply variables in the `compose_email()` function directly. For example, the `{sender}` part references an object *not* in the global workspace. Rather, it refers the named argument `sender = "Shelly"` in the function call. The order of searching is from within the function first, then, the search moves to variables in the global environment.

```{r compose_email}
# Generate the body text for the email message
email_text <- 
"
Hello,

This is a great photo of Lake Tahoe. I took \\
it using my new camera.

![]({img_link})
      
You should go if you get the chance.

Sincerely,

{sender}
"

email_object <-
  compose_email(
    body = email_text,
    footer = 
  "Email sent on {current_date_time}.",
    sender = "Shelly")
```

Some more notes on style are useful here. The `\\` is a helpful line continuation marker. It'll help you break long lines up when composing but won't introduce line breaks or new paragraphs. I recommend formatting like above with few indents so as not to induce the `quote`-type formatting. Any literal quotation marks should be escaped using a single `\`. Blank lines separating blocks of text result in new paragraphs. And, again, any valid **R** code can be enclosed inside `{...}` (e.g., `{Sys.Date()}`).

After creating the email message, we can look at it to ensure that the formatting is as expected. Simply call the object itself and it will be displayed in the Viewer pane.

```{r preview_email, eval=FALSE}
# Preview the email
email_object
```

### Sending an Email Message

We can store email credentials in a file using the `create_email_creds_file()` function. Here is an example showing how to create a credentials file as a hidden file in the working directory.

```{r credentials_1, eval=FALSE}
# Create a credentials file to facilitate
# the sending of email messages
create_email_creds_file(
  user = "user@site.org",
  password = "<user_password>",
  host = "smtp.blastula.org",
  port = 465,
  use_ssl = TRUE,
  sender = "The User's Name",
  creds_file_name = ".email_creds"
)
```

We can also use preset SMTP settings. For example, if we would like to send email through **Gmail**, we can supply `provider = gmail` to not have to worry about SMTP settings:

```{r credentials_2, eval=FALSE}
# Create a credentials file for sending
# email through Gmail
create_email_creds_file(
  user = "user_name@gmail.com",
  password = "<user_password>",
  provider = "gmail",
  sender = "Sender Name"
)
```

This will create a hidden credentials file in the working directory, the name of which is based on the provider (you can optionally specify the name with the `creds_file_name` argument, as in the first example).

Having generated the credentials file, we can use the `smtp_send()` function to send the email. 

```{r smtp_send_1, eval=FALSE}
# Sending email using a credentials file
smtp_send(
  message = email_object,
  from = "user@site.org",
  to = "another_user@web.net",
  subject = "Testing the `smtp_send()` function",
  creds_file = ".email_creds"
)
```

Alternatively, one can set a number of environment variables and use `Sys.getenv()` calls for email credentials arguments in the `smtp_send()` statement.
  
```{r smtp_send_2, eval=FALSE}
# Sending email using environment variables
smtp_send(
  message = email_object,
  from = "user@site.org",
  to = "another_user@web.net",
  subject = "Testing the `smtp_send()` function",
  sender = Sys.getenv("BLS_SENDER"),
  host = Sys.getenv("BLS_HOST"),
  port = Sys.getenv("BLS_PORT"),
  user = Sys.getenv("BLS_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("BLS_PASSWORD")
)
```

The underlying HTML/CSS is meant to display properly across a wide range of email clients and webmail services.

### Installation Requirements (`mailsend-go`)

The **blastula** package is moving toward using a new binary for `smtp` mailing, provided by the **mailsend-go** project. This binary is cross-platform and works on **Windows**, **macOS** (via **Homebrew)**, and **Linux** (**Debian** and **RPM** packages).

#### macOS (Homebrew)

Ensure that [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed. Then use the following to install `mailsend-go`:

```
$ brew tap muquit/mailsend-go https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go.git
$ brew install mailsend-go
```

#### Windows

Get the latest [64-bit](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases/download/v1.0.3/mailsend-go_1.0.3_windows_64-bit.zip) or [32-bit](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases/download/v1.0.3/mailsend-go_1.0.3_windows_32-bit.zip) release. Unzip and copy `mailsend-go-dir\mailsend-go.exe` to the Windows PATH. Optionally, we can place the executable in the working directory of the **R** project that is sending email.

#### Additional Notes

Once the `mailsend-go` binary is installed and on the system path, we can use the in-development `smtp_send()` function for sending email. The other function for sending email  (`send_email_out()`) will undergo deprecation.

Currently, only the development version of the package (on **GitHub**) has the `smtp_send()` function.

### Notes on Sending Email through Gmail

Before using **Gmail** to send out email through **blastula**, there is a key **Gmail** account setting that must changed from the default value. We have to allow *Less Secure Apps* to use your the **Gmail** account. Details on how to make this account-level change can be found in [this support document](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).

### Installation of the R package

**blastula** is used in an **R** environment. If you don't have an **R** installation, it can be obtained from the [**Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)**](https://cran.r-project.org/).

The **CRAN** version of this package can be obtained using the following statement:

```{r install_cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blastula")
```

You can install the development version of **blastula** from **GitHub** using the **remotes** package.

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("rich-iannone/blastula")
```
